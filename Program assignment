Write a GMP-based program that can perform Schnorr signature scheme.
The students should use the basic operations of cryptography in GMP to write the
program. Moreover, the hash function program, such as SHA, can be found (some
open source programs) on Internet in C language. The students should also write
an UI to process the file for key generation, signing and verification.
